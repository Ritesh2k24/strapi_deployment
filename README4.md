TASK: 7 - Deploy a Strapi application on AWS using ECS Fargate, managed entirely via Terraform and Automate via Github Actions [ci/cd] and Add CloudWatch for Monitoring (Logging & Metrics)

üîß Overview
This task focuses on deploying a Strapi application on Amazon ECS Fargate, utilizing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform, and automating the deployment workflow via GitHub Actions (CI/CD pipeline). Additionally, Amazon CloudWatch is integrated for real-time monitoring of application logs and performance metrics.

üõ†Ô∏è Key Components
1. Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
Terraform is used to provision and manage:

-VPC, Subnets, and Security Groups

-ECS Cluster

-Fargate Task Definitions

-ECS Services (Load-balanced)

-CloudWatch Log Groups and Alarms

2. ECS & Fargate Setup
   
-A Strapi container image is pulled from Amazon ECR

-Deployed as an ECS Fargate task behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB)

-Environment variables are injected securely through Terraform

-The service is exposed on port 1337 for the Strapi Admin UI

üöÄ Continuous Deployment with GitHub Actions

-A GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline automates:

-Docker image build and push to ECR

-Terraform plan and apply for infrastructure changes

-Secret management using GitHub Secrets (AWS credentials, keys)

-This enables seamless deployment on each push to the main branch

üìä CloudWatch Integration

a. CloudWatch Log Group

-Terraform provisions a Log Group: /ecs/strapi

-The ECS task definition uses the awslogs driver to stream container logs

-Log Streams follow the format: /ecs/strapi/strapi/<task-id>

-This allows for real-time troubleshooting and error tracking

b. CloudWatch Metrics Monitored

-ECS service metrics automatically collected:

-CPUUtilization

-MemoryUtilization

-TaskCount

-NetworkIn / NetworkOut

c. CloudWatch Alarms:


-Alert if CPU > 75% 

-CloudWatch marks the alarm state as ALARM

-Trigger auto-recovery or autoscaling

-Monitor for failed deployments or unhealthy containers
